The state of Rhode Island currently reimburses the MBTA for all operating expenses south of the RI&#x2F;MA state line, and they just funded a commuter rail extension south of Providence to attract intra-RI commuters to take transit to Providence instead of driving. However, even providing incentives such as free parking, ridership at these stations has pretty drastically missed expectations [1], and the trains are scheduled to take the same time as the bus takes in rush hour traffic. The commuting situation&#x2F;parking isn&#x27;t bad enough in RI like Boston or New York to make the train obviously beneficial time&#x2F;money wise, when you lose schedule flexibility of when you can go to&#x2F;leave work.<p>B. The site of the proposed train station only has two passenger tracks and is located in a high speed (125 MPH or 150 MPH) zone. Starting service to the station is not as simple as just refinishing it and having trains stop there: Amtrak (which owns the tracks) would probably insist that the state of Rhode Island quad-track through the station so that its trains can pass a stopped commuter train.<p>C. It&#x27;s difficult to get transit projects funded near state borders, because of the mindset of &quot;we paid for it and they all go work in the other state!&quot;.<p>Providence is a pretty fast-growing city, so it&#x27;s possible that in 5 to 10 years the traffic situation makes a much more compelling case for people to make use of transit, but additional commuter rail service there is a kind of hard sell.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wpri.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;south-county-rail-ridership-far-short-of-expectations-may15&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wpri.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;south-county-rail-ridership-far-s...</a>", "id": 12283037, "time": 1471121436, "type": "comment", "by": "rchowe"}, {"kids": [{"kids": [{"parent": 12283528, "text": "It&#x27;s an hour and 3 minutes from Richmond BART to Fremont BART, and Capitol Corridor takes an hour and 4 minutes to make the same trip.
