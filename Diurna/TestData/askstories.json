Other than that, no problems over the past 15 years, and I switched providers and systems at least three times over that time.<p>I&#x27;d encourage everyone to go ahead and do it. It isn&#x27;t very hard, cost on the order of several dollars&#x2F;euros a month, and you finally own your E-mail. I find it appalling that most people either use company E-mail (it isn&#x27;t yours, anyone can read it, and if you part ways with the company you have a problem) or Google Gmail (Google does read it, trains its algorithms on it, and targets advertising based on that).<p>Don&#x27;t worry too much about DKIM. It is no longer a good signal anyway, most spam gets it right.<p>So, if you&#x27;re capable of it, go ahead and run your own mail server. I wish more people did it, so that we could avoid the &quot;big guys&quot; restricting E-mail. If more individuals ran their own servers, we could democratize E-mail again: it wouldn&#x27;t be that easy to just reject E-mail for no good reason.<p>For the reference, the software I use right now is: Ubuntu LTS, postfix, postgrey, amavis, dovecot.

I haven&#x27;t had problems with delivery of outgoing mail except to a couple of poorly administered exchange hosts run by recruitment agencies - which complain about my mail but confusingly do still deliver it.<p>Two real problems I have faced...I once (embarrassingly) created a unix user with test&#x2F;test credentials for messing about and forgot that my postfix setup at the time reused unix credentials (ssh was locked down to only allow specific user to log in).  I sent a few million spams a hour for a couple of weeks, getting my host into all the DNS blocklists.  This took some time to fix (you have to apply to have your host removed from the blacklist).  While I&#x27;m sure sending all that spam was annoying to many other people it didn&#x27;t actually affect delivery for my mail...so it seems other administrators aren&#x27;t using DNS blocklists?<p>Second, after a while I started to get a lot of spam.  Maybe 10 per day.  I tried various things to handle this, including setting up a proper bayesian spam filter (amavis-new) and using DNS blocklists myself.  None of this worked for me.

Also, if working with a partner (which you do dismiss), you&#x27;re going to have to alternate.

Perhaps I could be more comfortable with benching alone if I did so in a cage, but I&#x27;ve never seen anyone else do that.

Commuting to work, for instance.

Here&#x27;s my advice.<p>.<p>Understand just what the overall reaction of the body to exercise can be.<p>* Some people are super responders, some people are super not-responders. Find out where you are and make peace with it.<p>* There is a tradeoff between tiring yourself out and replenishing your energy. Don&#x27;t overtrain<p>* There are two types of muscle short explosive muscle for strength and bulk and lean muscle for duration &#x2F; marathon<p>* Muscle training works by tearing the muscles a little bit. This needs to recover and regrow. Segment the muscles you train. Biceps and Triceps one day. Shoulders the next, then legs the following.<p>* A lot of exercise is boring. Treadmill esp. Consider watching a live sport while treadmilling... that keeps it more interesting. ( Get outside and use communal facilities )<p>* Exercise releases endorphines, which registers as pleasurable to you brain and body. However they are weak and only slightly addictive. Get to a place where your body craves the endorphin release of exercise. Remove caffeine and sugar from your diet which are much stronger than endorphines and erase the addiction.<p>* The body adjusts to any exercise and you get diminishing returns often. Switch your routine to incorporate different body parts.<p>.<p>Understand yourself.<p>Exercise within reasonable boundaries of what is possible for your body type<p>I&#x27;m 6&quot;2&#x27; and 100KG I just can&#x27;t do rock climbing easily, altough I look at American Ninja Warriors with envy.<p>Do you need a Personal Trainer to get motivated ?<p>Are you best in the morning or after work?<p>Things change with age.

Two of the obstacles were:<p>(1) Tedium. For my heart, I thought I had to run. For the other muscles, I thought I really should be doing 30 different exercises, split across three days, every week. Otherwise my body would become imbalanced from training some muscles and missing others. Some people enjoy this sort of thing. But for me it is mindnumbingly boring, and on top of that, physically uncomfortable. Boredom is one thing, and pain is one thing, but this kind of thing is boring and painful at the same time.<p>(2) Threshold. Once in a blue moon, I would feel motivated to exercise that much, but most days of the week, I didn&#x27;t. Those days, I might have been willing to go for a short walk or do one or two exercises. But I thought, such a small amount of exercise isn&#x27;t much better than nothing at all. Plus I&#x27;ll have to shower. If instead I spend the next 30 minutes working, running some errand, or even just unwinding, that will make a difference. Therefore I will do one of those things instead of lightly exercising.<p>So the two things that are maybe helping me overcome those obstacles are:<p>(1) Exercise programs like the StrongLifts 5x5 (which is <i>not</i> 25 different exercises). It is &quot;the Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press and Barbell Row. You do three of these exercises each workout, three times a week, for about 45 minutes per workout. You Squat every workout, three times a week&quot; (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stronglifts.com&#x2F;5x5&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stronglifts.com&#x2F;5x5&#x2F;</a>). I haven&#x27;t dived fully into the program, but the prospect of a few &quot;compound exercises&quot; is enticing, especially if they each develop several muscles at a time, so that with just these I will work out my whole body. This is a time-tested program, recommended by many people, and invented by the guy who trained Arnold Swarzenegger.<p>(2) Finding out that walking is good enough. Even the gym rats say that the best way to lose weight is walking, especially before breakfast. Okay, I sort of enjoy walking (sometimes). So if I feel like walking, I will!

It most often requires a buddy (who needn&#x27;t be at the same level) so you get a bit of human contact.

I don&#x27;t think it matters that you lose it fast, you need to feel healthy while doing it.<p>I started off following the Maffetone two week test:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philmaffetone.com&#x2F;2-week-test&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philmaffetone.com&#x2F;2-week-test&#x2F;</a><p>I found that I had the symptoms he describes of CI. After the two weeks I slowly introduced some carbs, only whole fruit type not any processed. Currently my daily diet is usually this:<p>Breakfast: Scrambled egg (Costco) recipe from The Four Hour Body book, I only use salt, pepper and parsley for spices. Add salsa and quacamole. Coffee (Aero Press)<p>Lunch: Chicken breast (Organic three pack Costco) pan fried with olive oil and butter. Usually spice with garlic salt, greek spices or barbecue type spices. Microwave in a small pyrex bowl the normandy vegetables (Costco) and add butter, salt and pepper. I&#x27;ll also do steak and fish. Usually I&#x27;ll cook the steak in a Sous Vide as I like the way it turns out and it&#x27;s easier for me to achieve a great steak.<p>Dinner: Green smoothie in a vitamix: Water, orange, banana, honey, vanilla extract, spinach, frozen pineapple.<p>Snacks and to deal with the carb demons: Raw unsalted cashews (Costco), cheese (sliced variety pack from Costco), Coffee (Aeropress both hot and iced &#x2F; cold press method).<p>The coffee has helped me kick the soda addiction, along with carrying an insulated water bottle (zojirushi)<p>I usually do a free day on Saturdays, but not always. Sometimes I&#x27;ll skip it especially if I had a couple of cheats during the week or my weight seems to creep up.<p>Workouts:\nI workout six times a week, I use the maffetone fat burning cardio training method three times a week for 30-40 minutes each with a heart rate monitor (works like magic for me, I don&#x27;t have horrible cravings as I&#x27;ve had on other kinds of workout plans):\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philmaffetone.com&#x2F;180-formula&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philmaffetone.com&#x2F;180-formula&#x2F;</a><p>The other three days a week I do Starting Strength with the iphone app. I&#x27;ve found the app to be invaluable in following it on my own. I have read most of the book and watched his DVD. I found starting out slow and really working on form helped a ton.<p>I feel a thousand times better on this program and it&#x27;s worked well for me. I was at a 32 BMI and brought it down to 25. I was about 250 lbs and now stay close to 200. Everyone comments on how different I look and I&#x27;ve noticed much better muscle definition and strength. I&#x27;m not trying to do muscle building or any extreme stuff, I just want to be fit and feel great. I&#x27;ve achieved that goal and with fairly minimal effort. I spend a lot less on food as I rarely eat out and I find it takes less time to make it myself.<p>It took a couple of hard weeks to change habits and get with the program. Once the habits were in place it&#x27;s been very easy. I naturally look for low carb and food that is close to the diet I&#x27;m trying to stay with. Whether it&#x27;s called slow carb, or paleo or whatever doesn&#x27;t really matter. Just figure out which foods work for maintaining your healthy weight and fitness level.<p>I think remembering how awful I felt about 100% of the time helps me to stay motivated with my diet and exercise. I think you really need both to make it work. If you focus on one and neglect the other you are likely sabotaging your effort.

Exercise in the modern world, when not part of your core occupation, is a bit of a luxury - it means you have the time, the energy, the money, and the health to do it. Many people don&#x27;t. People who have more balanced lives tend to exercise more and I think the causality is in the opposite direction than most people think.<p>You can&#x27;t &quot;make time&quot;. You can only prioritize something else lower and replace it with exercise. This doesn&#x27;t mean you ever had time. This is literally what not having enough time means. Most people don&#x27;t have a nicely allotted slot for exercise in their lives. Taking it up may mean losing something rather substantial, even if it doesn&#x27;t &quot;seem&quot; substantial. If we wanted people to exercise more, the first thing we would do is absolutely give them more time.<p>When I was in college, I played lacrosse. It would seem that this was very important but it was not. It resulted in falling grades for me and heightened depression due to falling grades. I dropped lacrosse because my grades were far more important. The reported mental benefits of exercise, however significant they may be, will not override the benefits of spending a lot of extra time on studying and then resting from studying. In the long run, improved grades facilitated me getting to a position where I could then afford the luxury of exercising. No amount of exercise could have done the same. Exercise is always, always secondary to being able to make a proper living and staying sane (unless exercise IS your way of staying sane, but it is not for many), and those things may very well eat up all your time. Before exercise can improve things, there needs to be something to improve.<p>I think this is a choice people make subconsciously, repeatedly. Exercise sounds like this thing you should always do because people perceive it as not having a cost, but it absolutely has a cost, and it&#x27;s not very cost effective compared to many, many things. The people you see who are doing really badly in the physical department are probably hurting on time even more than you are and the solution is not for them to start exercising but for them to have a more balanced schedule so it&#x27;s not so terribly difficult to fit exercise in it.<p>OK, there was my monologue. Now I&#x27;ll move on to how and why I exercise.<p>I mostly exercise for a somewhat medical reason: I have a very fast resting heart rate if I don&#x27;t do some exercise once in a while, combined with hereditary tachycardias. I would rather exercise than take questionable medication, and having a high resting heart rate is not very pleasant in general.<p>How I do it is pretty simple:<p>1. I&#x27;ve made peace with the fact that I&#x27;m not going to go very far in the exercise department and that I&#x27;m doing it primarily for the basic benefits. I&#x27;m OK with not being great at it, occasionally not doing it, not doing that much of it, not growing too much, etc., because it&#x27;s still a lot better than not doing it at all, and it gets the job done with regards to heart rate. This took a lot of pressure off because I used to have a lot of issues over not doing anywhere near as well as everyone around me was.<p>2. Given 1, I stopped worrying about developing some amazing regimen and decided to just look for a lazy, efficient way to fit exercise into my schedule. I chose to join a kickboxing gym for a wide selection of reasons:<p>- I don&#x27;t have to research or manage it. I just show up to the class and the instructor takes care of things;<p>- it&#x27;s in a closed gym. This is important because having to worry about weather used to really mess up my running schedule, due to high heat or thunderstorms;<p>- it&#x27;s scheduled, so I either have to go do it or not do it. I can&#x27;t &quot;do it later&quot;. Combined with it being expensive, I don&#x27;t want to not go do this thing I spent a lot of money on;<p>- while scheduled, it&#x27;s still flexible enough that I can somewhat adjust to wonkiness in my schedule, but not too much;<p>- it&#x27;s very efficient for time spent compared to most other forms of exercise I&#x27;ve seen;<p>- it&#x27;s relatively well-rounded so I&#x27;m not doing either just cardio or just weights;<p>- it&#x27;s social so there&#x27;s the added effect of performing a bit better because other people are around, the coach is watching you, etc.;<p>- it scales off of everything so it&#x27;s trivial to branch out if I want to add more cardio, lifting, etc., to it;<p>- kickboxing gyms are not rare so if I move somewhere I&#x27;d probably still be able to find one.<p>Cons: it&#x27;s expensive.

Eventually, I learned that staying put in the same place for a month or more was the best strategy \u2014 but this was hard to do with Schengen travel limitations (as an American citizen).<p>* Finding housing was sometimes a pain (and expensive). Hostels were definitely a no-go: too loud, no personal space, impossible to get work done. Hotels were too pricy. Owner-listed rooms on Airbnb worked pretty well overall, but finding ones that weren&#x27;t exorbitantly expensive ($35 or less a day) and that were rented out by people in the ballpark of my age required hustle. Longer house shares (often students living in a large house with a spare room) were the best bet, but finding them involved a lot of last-minute e-mails, phone calls, and even in-person interviews. (All this would have been much easier with a traveling companion.)<p>* Speaking of getting work done, I basically couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to be productive. Towards the second half of my travels, I discovered that I worked best if the room I was renting already had a desk, chair, and window, and sticking to that requirement helped quite a bit. But even then, the temptation to go out and explore was often too great. Before then, I tried cafes, libraries, and co-working spaces, all without much success. I think I really need a stable place to call &quot;home&quot; to be productive.<p>* As a life-long loner, travel made my social life a whole lot worse. I barely talked to anyone during my travels, and neither hostels nor bars were of much use. I didn&#x27;t really mind most of the time, but the fact that my only fulfilling interactions were over the phone did start to weigh on me after a while.

I lost both my dad and my dog to cancer within days of each other.

I wandered about ~9-10 countries in Asia over that period. I mostly talk from the perspective of doing it internationally.<p>There are a lot of factors to go into to decide whether it&#x27;s for you or not.<p>- The reasons why you do it: I am an Indian citizen, who cofounded a company in SF in 2012. I couldn&#x27;t get a H1B visa (2 years in a row), so I worked on my company remotely until I could figure out an O1A visa. I did it because I can&#x27;t get anything done at my parents&#x27; place in the Middle East, or with the shitty internet in India. I did it because it was the best among a few poor choices.<p>- What you hope to get out of it: I went in with few expectations, and so I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. All I was looking for was good food and quality internet. I got a lot of cultural exposure, interesting people, and a realistic understanding of what&#x27;s important in life. Don&#x27;t expect much pleasure and excitement from it, and you will be amazed by what you can find.<p>- Your financials&#x2F;work: I was making a below-poverty-line SF wage, but not living in SF. I had way more disposable income than I did living in the Bay. Traveling is suddenly way cheaper when you don&#x27;t have to pay a home-rent, and you&#x27;re making American wages in Asia. Never had to stress about money. Eating into savings to travel feels scary and makes you not want to leave your lodging. If you are a contractor&#x2F;freelancer, this is way harder to do I believe, as you have to synchronize with people who don&#x27;t know your lifestyle or work patterns well.<p>- Your citizenship: This makes a world of difference in how pleasant and stress-free the experience is. I had to spend multiple weeks in between every set of countries procuring visas from India to go to the places I wanted to go. I had to write off destinations just because of the hassle of getting visas and not because of time or money. If you&#x27;re EU&#x2F;UK&#x2F;American&#x2F;Australian&#x2F;Singaporean&#x2F;etc, you can enter most countries without ever needing to go home, allowing you to conveniently hop around at your leisure.<p>- Diet: If you have dietary restrictions, I would honestly think this shit is not worth it. Maybe I value food more than most people, but if it weren&#x27;t for the varieties of interesting and new foods that I could eat without fear or care for the ingredients, my travels would have been so much more stressful and so much less interesting and fun.<p>- Base cultural flexibility: Have you lived in multiple cultures before? Know how to not lord your culture as superior over others? Can take time to understand the realities of another country before you pass judgment about their morals and values? This is for the sake of both you and whoever you meet along the way.<p>I could go on forever, but if you have specific questions feel free to contact me via info in my profile.

I also set brightness around 20-30% on LCDs and turn DPI on Windows up to 125% to help with eyestrain.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pomodoro_Technique\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pomodoro_Technique</a>", "id": 12279967, "time": 1471055478, "type": "comment", "by": "UnoriginalGuy"}, {"parent": 12279774, "text": "There are three types of things which you should do in parallel:<p>1) Make your mind sharper<p>2) Make your tasks clearer<p>3) Make your distractions more distant.<p>--------------\n1. Sharpening your mind<p>Your mind is a part of your body, so you need to take care of your body.<p>A) Have good sleep hygiene. I need 8.5 hours of sleep a night to be at my best. Figure out what that number is for you and follow through on it. An extra hour of wakefulness is a waste of time if it makes you 40% as effective the next day. Make sure your mattress doesn&#x27;t suck. If it does, definitely spend the $200 for a new one[1]. Play white noise[2] on your phone and put your phone away from you as you sleep so you aren&#x27;t tempted by it at night. Spend $10 on a good sleeping mask [3]. Go to sleep and get up at the same times every day, even on weekends.<p>B) Eat good food with a high protein content. The very cheapest way to do this is something like soylent[4] and a blender bottle[5]. Somewhat better than that is using paprika[6] to plan meals and cook food with a timered slow cooker[7], but keep in mind that setting up an efficient kitchen takes time. Another method is to prep all your meals on Sunday[8]<p>C) Excercise and meditate regularly. A 20-minute intense run is really great for keeping yourself sharp. Not only that, but when you feel like your head is full of cotton, this is a good way to clear your mind.<p>----------------- 2) Make your tasks more clear.<p>If your tasks or goals lack clarity, then it is that much harder to figure out what your next step is, so your brain will seek stimulation and micro-accomplishment where it can. This is a more complicated topic because it depends on your company culture. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is a good read on this topic.<p>Frequent communication is important. Daily standups are good. Pairing is great, particularly as you are starting out and you are at the keyboard so that someone&#x27;s knowledge flows through you.<p>With programming, one of the most important things you can do is use Test Driven Development. It leads you to break down tasks and give yourself a clear next task: make the failing test pass.<p>If you are asked to work with an API and the documentation is in a foreign language, insist that the company hires professional translation.<p>If you join a company and can&#x27;t find out whom you report to, start looking for a new job.<p>----------- 3) Make distractions more distant.<p>Replace the &quot;frequently visited pages&quot; new tab screen with a calming natural image[9].<p>Block yourself from visiting distracting pages using Freedom, which lets you make different sets of urls to block and lets you schedule them to come on automatically[10].<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;products&#x2F;90283797&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;products&#x2F;90283797&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;rainy-mood-rain-sounds-for&#x2F;id566752651?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;rainy-mood-rain-sounds-for&#x2F;i...</a>  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.TailoredMusic.RainyMood&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.TailoredMu...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bedbathandbeyond.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;product&#x2F;bucky-reg-40-blinks-ultralight-sleep-mask&#x2F;1043238446\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bedbathandbeyond.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;product&#x2F;bucky-reg-40-b...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soylent.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;powder&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soylent.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;powder&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G5PTTH0ftsY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=G5PTTH0ftsY</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paprikaapp.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paprikaapp.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesweethome.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;best-slow-cooker&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thesweethome.com&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;best-slow-cooker&#x2F;</a><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MealPrepSunday&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MealPrepSunday&#x2F;</a><p>[9] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;momentum&#x2F;laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;momentum&#x2F;laookkfkn...</a><p>[10] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.refersion.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;dbe7b2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedom.refersion.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;dbe7b2</a>", "id": 12281043, "time": 1471086233, "type": "comment", "by": "afarrell"}], "descendants": 9, "text": "I just started a new job (first out of college).

As a example, I&#x27;ve been a web developer for 20 years, and for my own projects at home I don&#x27;t even bother with web front ends; I use QML and QT and bang out a great UI in a fraction of the time it takes to produce a web UI. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle anymore, but then I have the luxury of my own projects not having many (any?) users beside myself.<p>As for back-end, I&#x27;ve actually seen a shift more towards &quot;systems&quot; e.g a set of isolated sub-systems interacting via event busses or queues over HTTP&#x2F;JSON either as micro-services or something close to that. Then a separate &quot;web front-end&quot; app pull data for output&#x2F;display, almost as a client to that system. So a cleaner separation of The Real System from Web Application Back-end.

I know they&#x27;re nonzero myself.<p>WebAssembly won&#x27;t turn the browser into a &quot;perfect&quot; runtime. Things will still be glitchy and slow and buggy and stuff, like they are today. Except now there will be multiple WA implementations, with low-level bugs 99% of webdevs won&#x27;t be able to debug... :D<p>It may be helpful to see WA as a W3C-ratified JVM (Java VM) for your browser: like the JVM, WA is bytecode-based, and like the JVM, WA will be targetable from many languages.<p>You might even compare it to JVM + Swing - where WA is the JVM, and the DOM (and all other related bits) are like Swing. (Swing is notorious for being slow, although it&#x27;s recently a lot faster.)<p>I think client-side will &quot;break though&quot; in the way you describe when there&#x27;s something that bridges the (relative) ease-of-use of the DOM and the performance&#x2F;accelerability of WebGL. I doubt that will happen soon though, considering the cementedness of HTML+CSS and the associated investment (eg full-stack CSS3 hardware accel).<p>-<p>I don&#x27;t have a clear picture of the backend side of things at the moment, but I can offer these comments:<p>You&#x27;ve probably heard of WebTorrent. WebTorrent is not BitTorrent, because WebRTC P2P channels use SCTP on top of DTLS, which is effectively UDP on the wire. Besides being a headache for sysadmins who manage deep-packet-inspecting proxies, this essentially isolates the Web as its own &quot;network&quot; in practice - the only way you can talk to servers is via TCP+HTTP or UDP+DTLS+SCTP+&lt;your protocol&gt;. This makes things somewhat difficult. WebTorrent is actually a fully independent network that uses SCTP instead of TCP or UDP - the protocol is the same, it&#x27;s just tacked on top of SCTP (&amp; co). I expect (or at least hope!) that in a couple years next year most BitTorrent clients will have WebTorrent support.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that mobile networks are notorious at handling &quot;unusual&quot; data, because cellular data gets mangled by lots of pesky&#x2F;fussy infrastructure as it bounces between your device and what might be considered the &quot;traditional&quot; Internet backbone. I&#x27;ve heard UDP is touch-and-go, for example, or even access to unusual ports. There&#x27;s also the well-known fact that radio dropouts are still common and fundamentally hard to fix, even in 1st-world areas. This makes peer-to-peer networking incredibly hard.<p>A relay-as-a-service system to handle issues like these (SCTP-&gt;TCP gateway; connection persistence (very hard); etc) would make for an excellent DDoS generator, so at this point these types of things would need to be fixed at the application level, on a case-by-case basis. Unfortunately.<p>For another example consider Skype, which recently switched to an entirely client-server model, wherein the client talks solely to Microsoft servers; in the old days if the Skype client decided you had an awesome CPU&#x2F;RAM and network and your NAT config was sane, it made you a supernode for clients who didn&#x27;t have working NAT.

Without making mistakes you will again just have followed the bouncing ball on a bunch of exercises. It is when you have to find what you did wrong that you start to learn.  This is not a typing exercise, you need to understand what you are putting on the screen and the only way to do that is to make mistakes and fix them.<p>- You need to be willing to hack things around. Don&#x27;t just do the exercises, they are just typing practice.  Take the code you have written in the exercise and do something different with it.  If you are playing with graphic routines, see if you can make it into a simple game, or make it draw something different.  If you are playing with text, see how many ways you can put the a set of words together that make sense.  Play with your code, this is meant to be fun. Remember how you used to feel when you were playing with Lego when you were a kid and see if you can capture that same feeling.

Keep having ideas and making them a reality! The moment you give up is the moment your projects will fail. Each day, you have a chance to seize your opportunity.<p>Longer story made shorter:<p>I never stopped learning though I stopped learning code for a long time. In fact, I had taught myself programming at 12 years old. I had tried and tried and I just didn&#x27;t get it. It was Visual Basic 3.0. I kept opening it up and trying new things, but always was unsuccessful. One night, I had a dream about programming and designing applications. I woke up and wrote my first program. It was just an eight ball that chose a random response when a question was asked, but it certainly led me to write other programs throughout my teenage years, mostly to interact with America Online.<p>At 18, I lost interest completely in programming and stopped. Almost a decade later... from going to college to living in another country, I came home, broke, with a college degree in psychology that wasn&#x27;t getting me anywhere, and I searched Craigslist, applying across the board to every single listing that seemed suitable. I applied even in areas that I knew I had no chance, or thought I had no chance, and one of those areas was a programming job.<p>I never thought I&#x27;d get a response, but this software company called me and tested me on my knowledge. While I didn&#x27;t get 100%, I got a pretty good score and they hired me on spot. The job required knowledge of Visual Basic 6.0. Never thought that would ever come in handy, but it did. After a few months of training, I was back in the game.<p>Long story short... I worked for a tyrant boss that paid me far less than what a programmer should have been making, and I ended up looking for other jobs. Instead of searching for another programming job, I began my path into web design and development. I honestly thank that boss for teaching me everything I know. I suffered a lot with him because he was so arrogant and loved to talk down to me, but if there was any great lesson I learned from him that I still use today, it is that before you can code, you must understand what you are coding.<p>That means: WRITE OUT EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU DO IT. EVERY PROCESS, EVERY OPERATION, AND THE GOAL OF EVERY PROCESS.  If you lose the vision of your program, than you have no program. Keep the focus and you will always be successful in whatever code you write.<p>I had already begun building websites, either for free or cheap so I decided to apply for other jobs about a year and a half after getting that first programming job.. I saw two jobs at the same time on Craigslist, and I ended up going for an interview for both.. the latter one didn&#x27;t hire me right away, but eventually called me back, stating that they interviewed over a dozen people and I was the only one qualified enough for major consideration, so I ended up getting them both. Both were web design jobs, but one required 8 AM to 5 PM while the other required 6 PM to 2 AM. I was also freelancing on the side and had several paying clients. So I was pretty much working until I passed out. I slept very little and never took a day off. Having student loan debt, I ended up paying off my $40k debt in under 3 years. But the experience I got in those 2-3 years was equivalent to give me 5+ years experience as a web designer and developer.<p>One of the companies that hired me specialized in designing weather modules that displayed energy data on kiosks for solar panels in corporate buildings. The other one was a media company and paid me to design custom news web pages for big corporations like Goldman Sachs, Walmart, Kelly Blue Book, Avon, TripAdvisor, and many well-known pharmaceutical companies.<p>After over a year and a half of working non-stop, the solar energy web design company laid me off. I was upset and it took me a few weeks to get used to the fact that I no longer would be working at this job. Lucky for me, they had offered me a severance package: 3 weeks paid vacation on the condition that I would not file for unemployment. Little did they know, I had the second job, so I couldn&#x27;t file for unemployment.  So I ended up getting paid for 3 weeks on top of getting paid for my other job.  That company ended up laying off everyone 6-9 months later and couldn&#x27;t even afford to pay their employees, my former co-workers anymore, so they all had to sue to get their paychecks.  It was a blessing in disguise to be the first to get laid off.<p>Anyways, I still worked for the night company from 6 PM to 2 AM and had my freelancing business. They would eventually give me a choice: move across the country or get laid off. I ended up moving and currently still work for them.<p>As far as what I do now: I picked up some big clients as a freelancer in the area who are making good money, so they pay me well to maintain their websites. I also run a few of my own websites that managed to get popular, so ad revenue kicked in and at least helps pay for the server and a few equipment items, such as my laptops when they break.<p>My most popular website is <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confessionsoftheprofessions.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confessionsoftheprofessions.com</a> which primarily focuses on what people do for work; mainly understanding jobs, careers, and the workplace. This attracts people from all walks of life and helps me network with hundreds of people and companies every year and I get to learn a lot of new information before it is ever released, as the website is sometimes a company&#x27;s primary source of information distribution.<p>I also learned PHP and MySQL databases so aside from my day job, at night, I build web apps.  Although I&#x27;m just getting into it, I&#x27;m hoping that it will bring in some recurring revenue.  I cannot reveal all the details of these web apps at this time, but lets just say: I look around the Internet and if I see something can be improved or offered at a better price, I build it and become the competition.<p>One of these web apps is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mypost.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mypost.io&#x2F;</a> which allows you to create beautiful simple web pages in minutes with just a few clicks. No registration, no account, no hassle.  In addition to this, Google Analytics is not installed to try and help users remain completely anonymous. This has led to an increase of visitors particularly in Russia and China with the United States just behind.<p>I am always in non-stop learning mode and certainly would love to find the time to learn Ruby. For my job, aside from building custom news webpages, I also try to predict and develop new web templates for what the Internet will look like in the years to come, particularly how people might read their news.  I love my job.. but if you asked me a decade ago if I would be where I am today, I would have probably believed it was never possible.<p>I will just finish with this: code is poetry and it is all about understanding what people want in today&#x27;s fast-paced ever-changing tech world. Sure, you have Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other large networks and you might think to yourself: What can I possibly make that hasn&#x27;t already been made?  The advantage we coders have over the big companies is that we can specialize in the small things and give the user a much more personal experience than the big guys can. It is something they have lost over the years and that becomes our advantage of developing new web apps.

I try to ensure my spending doesn&#x27;t exceed equivalent of \u20ac500 a month.<p>I still spend most of the day in front of the computer. The only difference is that I wake up and finish when I want. I work on my personal projects (without aim to make money), which I find more interesting than doing commercial CRUD apps.<p>My decision was largely influenced by a Danish guy living in the USA, who wrote this blog: www.earlyretirementextreme.com", "id": 12275547, "time": 1471009596, "type": "comment", "by": "rizn"}, {"kids": [{"parent": 12275006, "text": "The downside is that you need to be a landlord and this can be a risky proposition.

This happened to me this week where my machine wouldn&#x27;t boot and just black screened.  I had to boot into safe mode with the graphics card disabled + yanked and apply the O&#x2F;S upgrade.  That got me far enough that after a very slow boot up I could start without safe mode, which let me reinstall the bootloader.  I also upgraded the graphics driver and did a few other settings tweaks and now its back and happy again and the graphics card is back in it. But there was a lot of rebooting and using my laptop to surf the web to figure out possible solutions and trying multiple different dead ends before I started to make progress in making it more bootable.<p>I&#x27;m pretty comfortable messing around with this stuff having started my career as a PC tech 25 years ago, and first started building my own patched linux kernels sometime in the late 90s.<p>I&#x27;ve got a friend of mine that uses macs professionally to do video editing and if she had to go through this she&#x27;d be even more dead in the water than me and would probably take her longer to recover and my advice to her has been that I don&#x27;t know how to build a hackintosh that she could rely on day-to-day without suffering interruptions like this.<p>I&#x27;m actually happy enough with it that I&#x27;m not going back to windows and not interested in buying a MacPro, but its not for everyone.<p>One thing that was a showstopper for me with my Linux desktop (and I do miss my il3 tiling window manager) is that when I bought a 4k display so that I had mixed 4k + 2x 2.7k displays xorg just became a total clusterfuck.  They pin all the displays to 96dpi and you can&#x27;t change it and have to set font-sizes per-application -- and then AFAIK nobody has any solution to having different resolution displays that you drag windows between.  I found an open issue which just had some xorg dev explaining down to everyone how they didn&#x27;t really need resolutions that small other than on phone screens.  On the other hand Mac + Windows Just Works(tm) and I can setup the scaling and drag windows between monitors and they don&#x27;t change size.

In my case, to get everything working, I had to wipe my OS (since a GPT partition table is required), install, bail out and reinstall after finding the right combination of kernel flags, and then after I got it running, I had to hex edit my graphics driver (!!!) to get the second display to work.<p>* Updates are scary, and will ~%50 of the time lead to a broken system.

It works great except but I don&#x27;t have a webcam, bluetooth, or wifi hardware in it.<p>I have a GTX 980 Ti OC hooked up to a Dell 5k monitor.  Performance is great for general usage and gaming.<p>One annoyance, which I still have to deal with to this day, I can not boot the OS with the monitor on or the kernel will panic and reboot.  I have to turn the computer on, wait for the boot loader, hit enter and quickly turn the monitor off, then after about 40 seconds I turn the monitor back on and OS X is working.<p>For some reason, when I full frame a video that is playing in the browser the frame rate drops to like 10 fps.  It&#x27;s kind of annoying.  It has something to do with the type of video encoding.  I suspect one of them is hardware decoded and other entirely in software.  Not sure the specifics.  When that happens I usually just zoom in (Ctrl + scroll wheel).  If I download the video and then play it in VLC it plays full screen at the full frame rate no problem.  Not sure what is going on.<p>Gaming was completely fluid.  I was playing Heroes of the Storm and StarCraft 2 fine.  There are some minor issues with the gamma and mouse not working right but there are easy workarounds.  Problem was just limited to HoTS.  I never saw the display &#x2F; mouse problems in any other program.<p>One other thing that annoyed me was that FCP X and Adobe Premiere would not use the GPU for anything.  My MacBook Pro is much faster for 4k video work than my super beefy Hackintosh.  I think it has something to do with Intel QuickSync not being recognized on the Hackintosh even though  my CPU supports it.  Couldn&#x27;t find a way to make it work.  Supposedly very little of video encoding uses the GPU for some reason.<p>RAW photo converters like Capture One Pro takes advantage of the GPU just fine.  Processing RAW photos is about 10x faster on my Hackintosh than my MBP.<p>Coding works great, torrents work fine, watching movies work perfectly fine with VLC.  No issues whatsoever with those things.<p>I also had some issues with video conferencing solutions like WebEx and Blue Jeans.  I had to use my MBP for those.<p>Be careful of updating on a Hackintosh.  Wait for the community to vet an upgrade.  Sometimes you need to reinstall things after an update.  I had 3 days where my graphics driver didn&#x27;t work after a security update.  Luckily nVidia released a driver fairly quickly.<p>If Apple ever comes out with a MBP I&#x27;m going to switch to that for a desktop.

The battery life is long, the case is light, the features are more than sufficient for development. My 2+ year old MBP is running like a champ (and if it wasn&#x27;t I would just take it to Apple, I have Apple Care, and they would fix it). Decide what you are buying the laptop for.

They have already begun dictating features and designs of the product since they will now be taking &quot;ownership&quot; of it worldwide.<p>From a business POV, I know this is a smart idea because it gives my company the leverage it needs to break into the global market and actually compete. From an entrepreneurs POV, I&#x27;m fucking sad. Our vision, our brand, our name...all gone. I feel like we sold out. But I can&#x27;t say no, because I&#x27;d be an idiot to say no to this deal.<p>Anyone else have experience in this area?
