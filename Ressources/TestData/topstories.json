Use that. Act on it.<p>* Check your logs for messages that indicate that others think you&#x27;re spamming.<p>* E-Mail forwarding is a tricky business these days.

I haven&#x27;t had problems with delivery of outgoing mail except to a couple of poorly administered exchange hosts run by recruitment agencies - which complain about my mail but confusingly do still deliver it.<p>Two real problems I have faced...I once (embarrassingly) created a unix user with test&#x2F;test credentials for messing about and forgot that my postfix setup at the time reused unix credentials (ssh was locked down to only allow specific user to log in).  I sent a few million spams a hour for a couple of weeks, getting my host into all the DNS blocklists.  This took some time to fix (you have to apply to have your host removed from the blacklist).

Maybe 10 per day.  I tried various things to handle this, including setting up a proper bayesian spam filter (amavis-new) and using DNS blocklists myself.  None of this worked for me.  Greylisting however worked great.<p>So my suggestions to you: use defence in depth for mail as well as ssh.  That means, fail2ban, different creds for both, unusual ports, user whitelists, high patchlevels (auto-patch and restart is great for a personal mail server) maybe client side TLS certs...etc.  If you&#x27;re relying on a single layer of defence eventually you&#x27;ll make a mistake with it and then you&#x27;re in trouble.

He&#x27;s likely put in prison, become accustomed to violence and injustice, pitting him even more against the &#x27;system&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;man&#x27; and then came out to no money and no job possibilities.

We got a bunch of them, too, so it worked imho. Thinking Machines explored the novel concept of massively parallel CPU&#x27;s with languages &amp; work distribution modified for them. Supercomputers of time had fewer, less-radical cores. Projects like Thinking Machines led to Massively-Parallel Processing architectures that combined hundreds to thousands of more-typical CPU&#x27;s, custom interconnects, and special tools for programming. My favorite of those were Distributed, Shared-Memory (DSM) machines. Later, Beowulf clusters were invested to use commodity CPU&#x27;s, boards, and networking to bring cost down. High-performance interconnects improved and got cheaper simultaneously. These trends led to commodity clusters from startups and semi-custom clusters from IBM (esp SP2), Cray, SGI, etc.<p>The reason for doing something so different &amp; risky like Thinking Machines Corp is to try to create those ripple effects. Well, build and dominate a market is number 1 but government funders trying to get ahead wanted ripples as a backup. They got it, too. Also, the machine could pull off amazing stuff [1] with its architecture. Similar one&#x27;s using 8-bitters piled into a chip were used for neural networks. One could probably re-created benefits of Thinking Machines same way for the problems that suited it.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kk.org&#x2F;mt-files&#x2F;outofcontrol&#x2F;ch15-d.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kk.org&#x2F;mt-files&#x2F;outofcontrol&#x2F;ch15-d.html</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monoskop.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;d&#x2F;d4&#x2F;Roland_Alex_Shiman_Philip_Strategic_Computing_DARPA_and_the_Quest_for_Machine_Intelligence_1983-1993.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monoskop.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;d&#x2F;d4&#x2F;Roland_Alex_Shiman_Philip_S...</a><p>Note: The book is well-worth skimming through given how it documents how modern computing practices formed.

John begins smoking it occasionally at the early age of 13. Through his newfound interest in marijuana, he starts visiting alternative websites, listening to the Doors, reading books by writers like Hunter S. Thompson, and eventual Aldous Huxley. John continues smoking weed, increasing to daily, as he finds it opens his mind to being more creative and understanding the content better.<p>At 15, John moves to a city 3 hours away that has a university. He looks into University courses and sneaks his way into the larger seminars after high school, on topics such as the existence of UFOs and quantum mechanics. He begins smoking pot with university students after seminars and has rich discussions with them. This leads to joining the local anime club and computer science club. Pot still remains the social lubricant for John and his social circle.<p>Flash forward: John has moved to the other side of his large country, is an IT manager at a world-class organization as well as a private contractor, lives a comfortable middle-class life with a long term partner.

That&#x27;s the very reason why we have so many opiate addicts. As a former opiate user who almost fell down the rabbit hole (unfortunately, my brother eventually <i>did</i> fall down that hole), by demonizing heroin, you set it apart from other opiates like Codiene, Vicodin, and Percocet&#x2F;Oxycontin. It&#x27;s not any different from those drugs. I found out the hard way. All of those drugs are opiates and if you were to snort heroin and if you were to snort Oxycontin, you would almost certainly prefer the oxycontin. It&#x27;s a much cleaner, longer lasting high while the heroin high kinda blows. Taking it in pill form isn&#x27;t any different. Heroin is only sorta useful when it&#x27;s taken IV or smoked, but heating it up destroys the compounds which get you high so it&#x27;s not a very good ingestion route.<p>Pure heroin is quite harmless by itself (provided you didn&#x27;t take too much). People can live a full and complete life totally addicted heroin with probably less risks than even pot. The problem of heroin is never direct -- it kills&#x2F;harms via overdose (misjudging a dose, or doing the same amount after your tolerance drops) or the most common &quot;overdose&quot; we hear of is when Fentanyl gets cut into your heroin (Yes, Fentanyl is <i>way</i> more potent than heroin and hospitals prescribe it all the time). The other ways people die is by mixing heroin with other stuff, namely xanax. You virtually never hear of someone just dying from heroin alone. And have you ever heard of someone getting lung cancer from their heroin?<p>The drug itself isn&#x27;t like crack or meth where doing it for an extended period of time can permanently turn you crazy (Psychosis). Or kill you from exhaustion&#x2F;sleep deprivation. People can take it for decades and show no obvious signs (functioning addict). The drug is always labeled &quot;super hard&quot; by the same people carrying around Percocets in their purse. But that&#x27;s OK because they got it from a dentist&#x2F;doctor. Percocet is oxycontin mixed with Acetaminophen and Oxy is almost as strong as heroin per mg.  Demonizing heroin while you&#x27;re taking vicodin or oxy is so hypocritical that there should be a new word invented for it, something that means &quot;more than hypocritical&quot;.<p>Heroin&#x27;s problem lies in that it really doesn&#x27;t have a great medical application. What it does, other drugs now do literally (not figuratively) 1000x better. But heroin is incredibly cheap to make (relatively speaking) and provides a unique rush when taken IV. There are other drugs (like Demerol) which provide that same rush but hospitals instead inject it into your fatty tissue (ass) so it&#x27;s slow to release (so you can&#x27;t get the rush). So why don&#x27;t drug kingpins make that stuff instead? Because those pharmaceuticals (like Vicodin, Demerol, and Fentanyl) require complex processes (many steps) and expensive labs to make well, and it&#x27;s way more expensive than Heroin. Not just cost-wise but also time-wise. When you&#x27;re out in some back-country in Afghanistan mixing your freshly dried Opium in a vat of Acetone to dissolve it, you&#x27;re on the clock to get in and out with the product or the boss is going to be pissed.<p>I realize I&#x27;m starting to rant but that&#x27;s because I myself always though &quot;drugs are bad!&quot; then I tried pot. Realized it wasn&#x27;t that bad, safer than alcohol. That same &quot;Well that&#x27;s not so bad&quot; happened to me with heroin. After snorting it I was actually disappointed and thought I was ripped off. I didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t stronger than Oxycontin. I thought it was orders of magnitude stronger than these harmless little pills my dentist gave me when I got my wisdom teeth pulled. I was wrong.

Functions are nature&#x27;s function techniques. And compression is nature&#x27;s set of compression techniques.<p>You might find category theory useful here.[0][1][2]<p>Take the category Set, which is the category of sets.[3] Just imagine an n-dimensional structure of dots and arrows, where the dots and arrows can each represent some other n-dimensional structure of dots and arrows. Set is the structure of that form which is constrained precisely so that it represents the idea of sets, and functions between them.<p>You can consider other structures like Set[4] that are constrained (or freed) to represent all manner of properties, structures and other stuff. Some of this stuff resembles branches of mathematics. Some resembles physics. Some resembles philosophy.<p>Science takes observation and uses mathematical models to transform that observation into prediction. So long as a model is sufficiently general, in a computational sense, then you will find that you _can_ rewrite the whole of science in terms of that model. But this doesn&#x27;t consider the question of elegance -- and the related question of what you want to consider fundamental. And the product question of those two: how do you measure&#x2F;compute most effectively to maximize elegance-of-stuff upon that fundamental-structure?<p>As someone who cares deeply about constructive mathematics, I consider things like topoi, the Curry-Howard(-Lambek) isomorphism[5], and Grothendieck&#x27;s relative perspective[6] to be fundamental, and a beautiful foundation for the modelling of any and all information dynamics (\u2243 &#x27;nature&#x27;, &#x27;thought&#x27;, &#x27;computing&#x27;). You may have some other perspective. There is a vast space of ways to approach the problem of modelling experience.<p>To be scientific, the thing to avoid is appending some _intention_ to the processes that your model describes. Causality is real and everywhere, but there is no way to say &quot;nature compresses by using probability and functions&quot; that doesn&#x27;t beg the question. Either compression, probability and functions are part of your singular model of nature, or they are competing models. You do math -- or coming from different directions you do physics, info theory, etc. -- by finding a general method that reworks them as a coherent idea.<p>You&#x27;re doing the first step of that when you form a surface analogy between (probability,functions) \u2243 (nature,compression).<p>If this kind of question bothers you enough, you can make it your life&#x27;s work to follow the rabbit hole all the way down. It&#x27;s not so much a question of smartness (though rigor is a huge part of truth-seeking) -- just how inexorably bothered you are by the idea of competing models of reality.<p>Cryptography, machine learning, and complexity theory are immediate implications of analogies similar to your own (p,f)\u2243(n,c). Should you want to study further (and don&#x27;t particularly identify with the constructivist tone of this comment), those are probably the most appropriate fields in which to look for elegant solutions to your questions.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category_theory\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category_theory</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;nPOV\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;nPOV</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;math&#x2F;0004133\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;math&#x2F;0004133</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category_of_sets\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category_of_sets</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Topos#Elementary_topoi_.28topoi_in_logic.29\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Topos#Elementary_topoi_.28topo...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspon...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grothendieck%27s_relative_point_of_view\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Grothendieck%27s_relative_poin...</a>", "id": 12281977, "time": 1471104998, "type": "comment", "by": "torustic"}, {"parent": 12281516, "text": "What does that even mean.", "id": 12281660, "time": 1471099100, "type": "comment", "by": "GFK_of_xmaspast"}], "parent": 12280702, "text": "Someone smarter than I will likely know this but are probability and functions nature&#x27;s compression techniques?", "id": 12281516, "time": 1471096741, "type": "comment", "by": "Yhippa"}, {"kids": [{"parent": 12281746, "text": "Really?

Weekends I would have cheat meals usually a pizza day and burger&#x2F;fry day.<p>Around then I began running for the first time in my life. I started out the first 3 months at 1 mile everyday, which I thought was a lot until a high school buddy laughed when I told him.<p>I stopped eating paleo and increased to 3 miles about 5 times a week.  This went on for about a month, when I decided to register for a half marathon and started a basic 12 week training.  I tried to restart paleo, but about a month in my legs began to hurt which I attributed to lack of carbs so I again got off.  During Summer in Miami I decreased the mileage due to the heat and would get back on paleo still weekend cheat days.<p>During any of that time I didn&#x27;t know about Ketosis or I never experienced anything I would call Ketosis.<p>Fast forward to this year, I completed the Disney Goofy (half day1, full day2), then another 2 halfs during the spring.  I was back to about 170, and despite running more mileage than I ever had, I was not pleased with my physique, feeling I looked better even at the same weight while on paleo.  So I decided after my last half of the season, I would try to go full paleo without any cheat meals on the weekend with the goal of 5 mile runs 4-5 times per week.  I just completed a half the weekend before and Tuesday I did my 5 mile on paleo and felt fine&#x2F;normal.<p>Wednesday&#x2F;Thursday during my runs I got light head and basically though I might blackout, never experienced that before, but I stuck with it.  Then by the 3rd week, I honestly felt I was tapping into a different energy source, not that I was running faster but it was just a different feeling and it was amazing.<p>Despite having combined paleo and running before, my body had never responded like this before.  Having read up on high endurance athletes who do paleo after the fact, I believe what was happening is my body was tapping into and burning fat as its main source of energy and I also learned about Ketosis at that time (I believe&#x2F;understand these to be one in the same, but they may not be).  I will note, even my mind seemed different as I began to really think&#x2F;feel that sugars were a poison and I was disgusted by the thought of breads&#x2F;sugars, meaning I didn&#x27;t even want cheat days on the weekend.  This lasted for about 2 months without a cheat day and eventually there was a craving for carbs and I had no hesitation about giving in, so I am back off the paleo, and basically the very next run my body was not performing the same as it was.  I look forward to implementing a strict paleo diet again without cheat days  when the weather cools and I will try to build my mileage up in that state for the next running season.", "id": 12279783, "time": 1471051581, "type": "comment", "by": "will_brown"}, {"kids": [{"kids": [{"deleted": true, "type": "comment", "id": 12281001, "parent": 12279731, "time": 1471084900}], "parent": 12279688, "text": "They got carbs from fruits, starchy root vegetables and whole grains.

It had been built on dot-mil and dot-edu, on public funds. Programmers shared source code; if you needed something, someone gave it to you. A dot-com address was considered crass. It was \u201cas though all of TV was PBS,\u201d Lindner says. \u201cNo commercials.\u201d<p>Those really were the days.  I remember the Canter &amp; Siegel spam, and how appalled we all were to see it.  The Internet then was more genteel.  Honestly, I wish it were still non-commercial: available to be used by companies (as it was even in the 90s), but not as an advertising medium.<p>&gt; At GopherCon \u201993, Yen announced that for-profit Gopher users would need to pay the U a licensing fee: hundreds or thousands of dollars, depending on the size and nature of their business. Many users felt betrayed. In the open-source computing spirit of the day, they had contributed code to Gopher, helping the team keep up with the times. Now they were being asked to pony up.<p>As much as it&#x27;s become fashionable to group-hate esr the last decade or so, I think that it&#x27;s important to recognise his major contribution: persuading folks the free software (under a different name) can be good for business.  Imagine if the university had kept Gopher as GPLed software, rather than demanding money from its users.<p>&gt; At its peak, the Mother Gopher consisted of 10 Apple IIci computers. But when it was finally euthanized, who knows what shape it was in. There was no ceremony. Nothing was carted off to a museum.

Despite its broad deployment, the encryption protocols used by iMessage have never been subjected to rigorous cryptanalysis. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of iMessage to determine the security of the protocol against a variety of attacks. Our analysis shows that iMessage has significant vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a sophisticated attacker. In particular, we outline a novel chosen ciphertext attack on Huffman compressed data, which allows retrospective decryption of some iMessage payloads in less than 218 queries. The practical implication of these attacks is that any party who gains access to iMessage ciphertexts may potentially decrypt them remotely and after the fact. We additionally describe mitigations that will prevent these attacks on the protocol, without breaking backwards compatibility.

Tightly managed, if not abolished, violence and high communication capabilities (direct mind to mind like) are what we think as among the characteristics of developed civilizations.

There is a lot in the story that can be clearly interpreted in the science fiction style, and between God and aliens i bet on aliens :)<p>Now, here is the really fun part - an idea that we probably do have sample of the Jesus&#x27; alien DNA somewhere around (despite the aliens&#x27; precautions taken like the hard ultra-violet cleaning of all the biological material in the cave tomb of Jesus) - the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; whatever it is, like say the Dan Brown&#x27;s child&#x2F;ancestors of Jesus.

You pay the local refineries to extract the oil. In Istria (Croatia) where I live farmers take their olives to the refinery and get back the first run of cold-pressed oil (here it&#x27;s still pressed in hydraulic presses, not centrifuges). It&#x27;s what we call Extra Virgine and it&#x27;s the highest quality you can get. Refinery keeps the olives and further processes them to get the lower quality oils (at least 2 more runs) and in the end for bio diesel. I presume that&#x27;s where the most of the oil in shops comes from. The price individual producer can get is ridiculously low compared to the final price you pay in the supermarket, so most farmers prefer to sell it directly when they can.

It&#x27;s meant to make it easy to run many applications on one machine without the resource overhead of virtual machines. DBs are distinctly not well-suited to this environment. DBs require a good deal of tuning and hardware awareness to run properly. DBs want to run forever and keep frequently-used data in memory; often, restarting a DB server is a big deal because it makes the caches go cold and the server is slow until they warm back up. DBs don&#x27;t take kindly to sharing a box with 30 other applications. On a VM at least you know you have a dedicated chunk of memory. Not the case on a Docker host. As I discuss in C, Docker is basically the antithesis of long-running; there are many ways to make your container suddenly disappear or stop.<p>c) There are many non-obvious gotchas involved in Docker usage; it&#x27;s a very non-intuitive interface. For example, using `docker attach` to connect to a running container will often place the user in control of the process. A simple ^C, which most sysadmins would interpret as &quot;OK, I&#x27;m done with this log&quot;, closes the container&#x27;s process and cleans up your container. That&#x27;s just one example of a risk among many brought to you by the counter-intuitive and unfriendly Docker UX. Not the kind of fragility we want for something as mission-critical as a database system. Again, Docker is meant for processes that are consequence-free if they&#x27;re cleaned up. Their UX is obviously designed that way too. You&#x27;re supposed to run 8 containers from the same image and if one goes away the LB detects it and it&#x27;s nbd. Databases don&#x27;t work like that.<p>d) Docker sometimes becomes a zombie and fails to respond to commands. You can&#x27;t connect to any of your running containers. You can&#x27;t issue start or stop commands. You can&#x27;t get output from `docker ps`. This has happened to me on multiple occasions. Do we really want a production DB running in that context?<p>e) You mentioned it, but storage. Even persistent volumes can be a PITA to configure properly with Docker, and if you fail to do so, you are looking down a blackhole backed by the slow AUFS virtual filesystem. By default, all data written to a Docker container goes into its own differenced image and when you stop the container, it &quot;goes away&quot; (though it can usually be recovered by calling up the specific container ID instead of restarting from the image). These AUFS volumes have a habit of consuming a lot of disk space on the host, which sometimes causes point d to occur if you get to 0. Volumes cannot be mapped at build time and must be defined at runtime. There are many bugs with data volumes, including data loss bugs and filesystem feature bugs.<p>The long and short of it is that Docker is oriented toward applications that aren&#x27;t close to the metal and can have their log and write output easily redirected to more durable systems. This fits the bill for many web apps (the application part, not the database parts). It absolutely does not fit the bill for long-running, close-to-the-metal, mandatory-firm-and-reliable-storage systems like databases.<p>I use Docker to run local development databases (as well as applications). I wouldn&#x27;t use it for any DB more important than that.

This is my impression from reading, a year or so back, the same docs I just linked; you can read them for yourself and form your own opinion if you think this sounds crazy:<p>It seems like ERTS (the Erlang runtime: BEAM VM + associated processes like epmd and heart) has a pool of &quot;async IO&quot; threads, separate from the regular scheduler threads, that just get blocking syscalls scheduled onto them. Erlang will, if-and-only-if it knows it has pinned schedulers, attempt to &quot;pair&quot; async IO threads with scheduler threads, so that Erlang processes that cause syscalls schedule those syscalls onto &quot;their&quot; async IO threads, and the completion events can go directly back to the scheduler-thread that should contain the Erlang process that wants to unblock in response to them.\u2020<p>In the default case, if you don&#x27;t tell ERTS any different, it&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;ve got one (UMA) CPU with N cores, and will try to pin async IO threads to the <i>same</i> cores as their paired scheduler-threads. This has context-switching overhead, but not much, since 1. the async IO thread is mostly doing kernel select() polling and racing to sleep, and 2. the two threads are in a producer-consumer relationship, like a Unix pipeline, where both can progress independently without needing to synchronize.<p>If you want, though, you can further optimize by feeding ERTS a CPU map, describing how the cores in your machine are grouped into CPU packages, and how the CPU packages are further grouped into NUMA memory-access groups. ERTS will then attempt to schedule its async IO threads onto a <i>separate core of the same CPU package</i>, or if not possible, the same NUMA group* as the scheduler-thread, to decrease IPC memory-barrier flushing overhead. (The IPC message is still forced to dump from a given core&#x27;s cache-lines into the CPU or to NUMA local memory, but it doesn&#x27;t have to go all the way to main memory.)<p>ERTS will also, when fed a CPU map, penalize the choice in its scheduling algorithm to move an Erlang process to a different CPU package or NUMA group. (It will still <i>do</i> it, but only if it has no other choice.)<p>---<p>\u2020 This is in contrast to a runtime without &quot;native&quot; green-threads, like the JVM, where even if you&#x27;ve got an async IO pool, it just sees an opaque pool of runtime threads and sends its completion events to one at random, and then it&#x27;s the job of a framework like Quasar to take time out of the job of each of its <i>JVM runtime</i> threads to catch those messages and route them to a scheduler running on one of said runtime threads.<p>The same is true of an HVM hypervisor: without both OS support (paravirtualization) plus core pinning inside each VM, a hardware interrupt will just &quot;arrive at&quot; the same pCPU that asked to be interrupted, even if the vCPU that was scheduled on that pCPU when it made the hypercall is now somewhere else.

Early on most of that was in C, now it&#x27;s split about 50&#x2F;50 between C and Lua. Most of my C I&#x2F;O code is still in C because I prefer my libraries to be reuseable outside of Lua or any particular event loop, and they often are. Lua&#x27;s coroutines are usually higher up the stack, juggling more abstract state; and I use them for more than asynchronous I&#x2F;O or asynchronous tasks.<p>The thing about async&#x2F;await is that in a language like C, I can already accomplish much of that with tricks like Duff&#x27;s Device and macros. It has its limitations, but IME they&#x27;re not much more onerous than the limitations of async&#x2F;await, especially in the context of a language lacking GC. I have to manually keep state off the stack (or otherwise copy&#x2F;restore it), but you do that anyhow when you don&#x27;t have lexical closures and GC, and often even when you do.<p>The beautiful thing about coroutines in Lua is that it&#x27;s based on a threading model, but not one bound to the C stack or a kernel thread, which are completely orthogonal concerns left to the application to deal with or not deal with. And it does this while preserving functions as first-class objects. Neither callers nor callees need to know anything about coroutines. That kind of composability makes coroutines useful and convenient for many more things than simulating green threading or managing CPU parallelism. Among other things, it means I can mix-and-match functional and imperative styles according to the problem, and not whether it will be convenient to then make use of coroutines. It means that I have a single, natural call stack--not an implicit stack and an explicit stack. async&#x2F;await and futures unify your data stack, but you&#x27;re still manually managing the call stack through syntactic devices or otherwise formalized calling conventions. However heavily sugared, it will hinder the design of your software no less than if you had to manually manage the data stack, too.<p>Coroutines that aren&#x27;t stackful aren&#x27;t nearly as powerful in terms of problem solving. Without them being stackful, it&#x27;s a horribly leaky abstraction for non-trivial uses. Most people would agree that the C preprocessor is a mess, and that functions as first-class objects are powerful. So modern languages strive to create templating systems that allow you to construct _real_ functions that are indistinguishable from any another function. But then they introduce monstrosities like futures or async&#x2F;await, that beautiful symmetry is broken. It&#x27;s like bringing back C&#x27;s macro preprocessor--now you have regular functions and these weird things with different syntactic and control follow semantics, whether you wanted it or not. The decision is no longer yours, which means you&#x27;re bending to the language&#x27;s deficiencies.<p>Why even bother with such half-baked solutions? In almost every case it&#x27;s utterly transparent that these solutions exist for the benefit of the compiler and runtime author, usually because of intentional or unintentional technical debt--a direct or indirect dependency on the C or kernel stack. For C++ it&#x27;s understandably a difficult dilemma, but for every other language it&#x27;s a total cop-out.<p>Then these solutions are sold to the public by prettifying the implementations with fancy terminology and beguiling examples showing how they can be used to implement async I&#x2F;O or parallel CPU jobs. But few, if any, language features are so narrowly tailored to such specific use cases. Why? Because languages are supposed to provide simple building blocks that compose as seamlessly as possible at a much higher level of abstraction than, e.g., a slightly nicer way to implement HTTP long-polling servers. Such contrivances are as removed from the basic simplicity of the function as C&#x27;s macros are from first-class functions. In both cases you can implement solutions for a certain subset of problems that superficially look convenient and nice; but in the real world the limitations become swiftly apparent, and you realize a lot of effort was spent in design and implementation for little real-world gain.<p>With Lua&#x27;s coroutines, I can implement a futures pattern easily when it&#x27;s appropriate, and it will be more powerful because the futures themselves can make use of coroutines both internally and externally. But in my use of coroutines in Lua futures are rarely the most natural design pattern. Sometime you want a full-blown CPS solution, sometimes you simply want to be able to arbitrarily swap producer&#x2F;consumer control flow, for example in a lexer. Often you want a mixture of all of these. Coroutines--stackful coroutines--provide all that and more, seamlessly.<p>Futures only look nice and elegant in contrast to event loop oriented, callback-style programming.

This is not wrong per se, but calling the result a &quot;future&quot; alone oversimplifies what&#x27;s happening below and hides some properties about the combinations.<p>The first observation one can make - which is not mentioned anywhere in the article - is that the composition of futures here can be understood as a monadic composition. This by itself gives a big hint why this interface is so powerful. Second is that this library could be understood as an implementation of process and process combination from pi-calculus [1] - sequential combination, joining, selection, etc - so it could be formalized using its process algebra.<p>From the practical side, one example of a mature library that implements similar concepts is the LWT [2] library for OCaml, which has the same idea of deferred computation, joining and sequencing, but calls the computations &quot;lightweight threads&quot;. One could also argue about naming in this case, but it seem to reflect a better the idea of independent &quot;processes&quot; that are combined on the same address space.<p>Finally, as much as these concepts of futures and processes look similar on the surface, they each have their own properties - so it&#x27;s always good to consider what better fits the model. By looking at the research and at other similar solutions, one can make more informed choices and have a better idea of what to expect from the implementation.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~wing&#x2F;publications&#x2F;Wing02a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~wing&#x2F;publications&#x2F;Wing02a.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocsigen.org&#x2F;lwt&#x2F;manual&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocsigen.org&#x2F;lwt&#x2F;manual&#x2F;</a>", "id": 12271410, "time": 1470947925, "type": "comment", "by": "leovonl"}, {"kids": [{"kids": [{"kids": [{"kids": [{"parent": 12270358, "text": "Yeah, since rust is eager existential types seem like a necessary evil.", "id": 12270379, "time": 1470938451, "type": "comment", "by": "dukerutledge"}], "parent": 12270225, "text": "Yes.

You can balance how much contract work you take on against what you need to do for your side project. There may well still be a point where you have to give up a relatively large amount of immediate revenue from the (absence of) contract work in return for much less immediate extra revenue for your side business. However, if you think the side business will grow in the future based on that work, you might consider that a worthwhile investment.<p>Another advantage is that operating independently also usually means you have a contract to work on one specific project. That contract would normally be explicit that things like the IP rights transferred to the client are only those relating to that specific project. In contrast, an employment contract is usually broader, and shady employers often try to include clauses that claim IP rights to pretty much anything the employee ever does, out of hours or otherwise. This is a legal minefield and the effect of those clauses depends on where you are, but in any case the last thing you need if your side project starts to become successful is a dispute with a past employer&#x27;s lawyers.", "id": 12273085, "time": 1470969075, "type": "comment", "by": "Silhouette"}], "parent": 12270545, "text": "I found two useful solutions to this problem:<p>1.

(I know argument by analogy is crappy, i&#x27;m just hoping we can agree on this point, and i think we do.) There&#x27;s a whole other argument about why we would set up those legal rules, but i&#x27;d like to set that aside for a moment (if it&#x27;s a big deal, or fundamental in some way, i&#x27;d like to hear your side.

Perhaps every action we take is just like a heartbeat. I have no control over that. Perhaps when i hold my breath, i&#x27;m not actually choosing to hold my breath, but the complex system that is my body holds it&#x27;s breath and my mind is claims that it was responsible for that holding of breath. Or typing this comment, or whatever. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way i can know. It feels like my mind is in control, but my mind gets all of its information from (and the software runs on!) my body. my mind seems to control the hardware, but maybe i&#x27;m just rationalizing after the fact.", "id": 12273004, "time": 1470967423, "type": "comment", "by": "jfoutz"}, {"parent": 12272855, "text": "<p><pre><code>    &gt; There are a lot of people\n    &gt; who will not commit crime\n    &gt; only because they fear the\n    &gt; consequences\n</code></pre>\nReally?

I&#x27;ve noticed from several reports of personal email patterns (Wolfram and others), that about 300&#x2F;day is a typical upper bound.  That&#x27;s 1.6 minutes per email (or an email every 1.6 minutes) in an 8 hour day, though it&#x27;s not atypical to see patterns where someone dedicates a few hours of the day to managing emails.<p>I ran across a truly staggering statistic of the rise in the number of communications a manager received per year from 1970 to 2015.  On the order of ~400 (per year) to 30,000.  I suspect some possible undercounting (phone and direct in-person messages, as well as, say, message slips may have been omitted from the earlier tally), but that&#x27;s a change from ~2 messages per day to about 120.  The time and consideration given each <i>has</i> to fall.<p>I&#x27;ve spent quite some time pondering collaborative filtering systems.  Typically, these strive to rate and rank, and <i>sort by significance</i> individual messages.  On a typical Web or online service, <i>all visitors will see all messages, eventually</i>.  This can produce problems when, say, a top-ranked subreddit has several thousand comments in it -- it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect anyone to read them all, but also somewhat unfair to those who contribute later to be fated to not be seen at all.<p>The HN front page and new submissions pages suffer a somewhat similar problem.<p>One model might be to target a given page or platform for a set number of visible submissions at any one time, but using the content filtering system to adjust not the position on a page, <i>but the probability that any given user would see the content</i>.<p>An alternative might be to divide content into several categories, a logarithmic progression of quality.  I&#x27;m fond of Likert scales, usually 5-9 levels.  Here, the idea is that each level is an order of magnitude &quot;better&quot; (I&#x27;ll explain the quotes) than the previous, with increasing likelihood to be seen. <i>All</i> content should be seen by <i>someone</i>.  <i>Better</i> content is seen by <i>more</i> people.  With a five level scale, L-1 content is seen by 1:10,000 visitors, L-2 by 1:1,000, L-3 by 1:100, L-2 by 1:10, and L-1 by 1:1.  It might well be possible to work with smaller numbers of categories.<p>Another advantage is that this system would tend to reduce the filtering overhead as content was more highly rated, such that more trusted &#x2F; discriminating raters could be explicitly called in to assess the small number of highly-ranked posts.  The slush pile, as it were, is fanned out among many, the good content filters toward the top, where it&#x27;s multi-checked for quality (I&#x27;m assuming here that the objective <i>is</i> quality and not just &quot;attracts eyeballs&quot;), including being flaggable for various negative characteristics (misleading, spam, social norms violations, low-effort posts, etc.).<p>There&#x27;s also the challenge that explicit content rating tends to be problematic -- there are a few too many incentives to game <i>any</i> rating system, and much behavioral indication of quality or interest which <i>isn&#x27;t</i> explicit.<p>In the cranks&#x27;n&#x27;geniuses model, you&#x27;d divvy up your recipient pool such that incoming submissions get farmed out and no one evaluator has to see too many of them, but all submissions have at least a reasonable likelihood of being reviewed.

Fortunately, I&#x27;m a decent cook, but for a couple months I lived in illegally-run housing where you had five units sharing a tiny unventilated kitchen and an old fridge.<p>The landlord would go through and unplug the communal appliances (including the fridge) regularly to reduce energy consumption. I thought it was odd that the fridge was empty, except for sodas, when I got there, but I found out why pretty fast. Food would get stolen, I was regularly harassed (not &quot;oh, that guy hit on me and I didn&#x27;t like it&quot; harassment, but huge dudes with mental illnesses, prison records, and nothing better to do threatened to beat me up, and yelled at me over imaginary things they suspected me of, one guy threw a block of my cheese out the nearby bathroom window -- as a single female, I was an easy target), there was just a single bathroom for everyone, connected to the kitchen, and I watched people empty soda bottles of urine into the kitchen sink (yeah, super gross). The oven was so dirty the unventilated kitchen filled with smoke when you turned it on, and you had to stay there to make sure no one fucked with your food.

Having your own kitchen (or a kitchen with responsible people you trust), buying appliances, providing electricity, and maintaining everything is expensive. My own kitchen, big-ticket appliances aside, probably has thousands of dollars worth of gadgets, dishes, and cutlery in it right now -- I certainly don&#x27;t take that for granted anymore!

My husband, who was a music major for a year before dropping out of college, and I started getting in an argument about this episode that was so heated, I felt like we were listening to two completely different stories!<p>I kept insisting that the advanced math and education wasn&#x27;t just some funsies shibboleth the physicists had to keep the hoi polloi out of physics -- the devil&#x27;s in the details and the man in the story didn&#x27;t even understand the big picture correctly. My husband was angry and insulted that the physicist dismissed the man&#x27;s theory out of hand, and felt that anyone could make a contribution to physics with perhaps a little help from a calculus book -- just look at history! I thought the hero of the story (if there was one) was clearly the physicist, while my husband was solidly on the side of the electrician with a little learning, trying dangerous things.<p>I was really shocked. We don&#x27;t usually fight like that, and especially over something so seemingly trivial, but, in retrospect, I thought that it displayed huge tension in society as a whole, between academics and non-academics. We hear so much about the &quot;one percent&quot; and income-based class distinctions, but relatively little about academic barriers in society, whether real or artificially imposed. Should physics open up in a real way (not just &quot;pop science&quot; articles and occasional books for laymen)? Should we put a stronger &quot;academic&quot; focus in early public and high school education? Should we provide more resources for &quot;physicists who just need a little help with the math&quot; whether they&#x27;re right or wrong?<p>Although I was staunchly in favor of the hallowed halls of academe, and it still holds a special place in my heart, I suspect that the correct solution lies somewhere in the middle.

Each recipe comes with a handful of variations so you can see how you can start to build new dishes out of ones you already know.

I have to confess doing the same in many cases.<p>I believe this is the biggest problem with American diets: we try to abstract away the taste and focus on a feature list (anti oxydants, low-carb, high-this, low-that) and all the while rely on poor shortcuts for actual taste. Those poor shortcuts are of course sugar, salt and fat. My French background earns me a perception that I&#x27;m a food snob. Perhaps that&#x27;s true. But things don&#x27;t need to have fancy preparations to be appreciated, in fact less processing is usually more. I can appreciate the favor of unseasoned steamed rice at a Japanese restaurant, or fresh tomatoes from the garden with no seasoning.<p>And yes, over time, you will start craving higher-quality ingredients, for the simple reason you can taste the difference.

Gary Taubes&#x27; NYT article from 2002, &quot;What if It&#x27;s All Been a Big Fat Lie?&quot; [1] describes this phenomenon in detail, and tells how it&#x27;s been known to researchers for already quite some time. The explanation however, doesn&#x27;t seem to be merely &quot;psychological&quot; but rather physiological: in Taubes&#x27; words &quot;[Sugar, starches and floor] are known in the jargon as high-glycemic-index carbohydrates, which means they are absorbed quickly into the blood. As a result, they cause a spike of blood sugar and a surge of insulin within minutes. The resulting rush of insulin stores the blood sugar away and a few hours later, your blood sugar is lower than it was before you ate. As [David] Ludwig [a Harvard endocrinologist] explains, your body effectively thinks it has run out of fuel, but the insulin is still high enough to prevent you from burning your own fat. The result is hunger and a craving for more carbohydrates.&quot;<p>Personally, I moved to a low-carb style of nutrition about two years ago and, lost about 8kg over a period of several months and have managed to keep the low weight ever since, without suffering hunger or cravings. It may not sound like much, but I wasn&#x27;t obese to start with but towards the high end of the normal BMI range, whereas now I&#x27;m right in the middle of the range with a weight I hadn&#x27;t have since my early 20s (I&#x27;m 45 now).

With each of these changes came some weight loss and habit changes. Basically, all I found was to learn what works with your body and build healthier food habits.<p>First, I started eating less meat. This was mostly due to having gall bladder surgery: Afterwards digestion of those fats was more difficult. Though this improved, the habit stuck.<p>I started eating more vegetables. I didn&#x27;t cut fat or carbs or anything, just added in vegetables. A few formerly disliked vegetables are now in my pallet.

I don&#x27;t suggest this unless it fits with you, but I feel better and enjoy foods more. I did similar things with other foods - eat fruit instead of drinking fruit juice, whole grain pasta and better breads. I still dislike milk.<p>I cut out soda. I didn&#x27;t really plan to for weight loss, but after a while it tasted syrupy. I now only occasionally (every 1-2 months) drink it. I eventually cut out sugar from coffee, more for simplicity in ordering.<p>I started cooking daily, and if I want a certain food, I just plan to make it or buy it. I eat candy regularly, for example. I eat until I am very full every night. Most meals are simple, but I do make my own bread. This is more habit building than anything, but I found I enjoy food more and nearly always feel satisfied. It helped moving to a country with less ready-made foods.<p>I paid attention to when I am the most hungry. For me, no matter how much I eat during the day, I want a good deal of food in the evening meal, and generally want a nightly snack. I figured it was silly to eat lots during the day, and the my snacking habits just kept me going. Breakfast is usually black coffee.

Hobbyists print off weird new processor architectures on their home inkjets; middle-aged folks wipe their backsides with diagnostic paper that can tell how their cholesterol levels are tending.<p>The latest casualties of the march of technological progress are: the high-street clothes shop, the flushing water closet, the Main Battle Tank, and the first generation of quantum computers. New with the decade are cheap enhanced immune systems, brain implants that hook right into the Chomsky organ and talk to their owners through their own speech centers, and widespread public paranoia about limbic spam. Nanotechnology has shattered into a dozen disjoint disciplines, and skeptics are predicting that it will all peter out before long. Philosophers have ceded qualia to engineers, and the current difficult problem in AI is getting software to experience embarrassment.<p>Fusion power is still, of course, fifty years away.<p>-------------", "id": 12272381, "time": 1470957371, "type": "comment", "by": "zem"}], "parent": 12271563, "text": "Hilarious.

I&#x27;d like to leave HNer&#x27;s with some statistics that are not included in the NYTimes article that might explain why it is so vital to move any part of the agricultural crop away from opium:<p>Afghanistan&#x27;s opium production currently goes into more than 90% of heroin worldwide.<p>According to a UN doc cited on wikipedia, production reached a peak in 1999 with a bumper crop of 4,500 metric tons. [1] Shortly afterwards in 2000, 99% of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was wiped out by the Taliban, who controlled Afghanistan with an iron fist and declared the cultivation of poppy &quot;un-islamic&quot;. This amounted to a 75% reduction in the world supply of opium. So total world production was ~6,000 metric tons in 1999.<p>According to this 2014 UN report [2] the total area of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was estimated at 224,000 hectares with an average yield of 28.7kg&#x2F;hectare. Converting this to metric tons: 224,000 * 28.7 &#x2F; 1,000 = 6,429 metric tons of opium produced. Report cites a possible range from 5,100-7,800 metric tons produced.<p>So not only is Afghanistan back to pre-Taliban production levels, it is producing more than the entire world production of opium in 1999. This is just 15 years after a 99% eradication of the crop in the region. Ironically, opium production has ramped up massively since 2002, under US&#x2F;Karzai governance.<p>The farm gate value of this opium is only $850m. Using an average of the conversion ratios cited in the report (18.5:1 for pure heroin, 9.6:1 for export-grade heroin) and a price of $60,000USD&#x2F;kg of heroin [3] we get a total processed value of $27.4bn. That&#x27;s a crazy amount of value locked into processing and distribution.<p>Any amount of possible change towards other crops will be hugely beneficial for smaller-scale farmers who do not wish (or do not have the connections) to sell into the drug trade, and who only see 1&#x2F;30th of the processed value of their crop. Not to mention it will be putting a dent in the world supply of heroin.<p>This is an ambitious and well-intentioned project. I&#x27;m glad to see HN sponsoring these types of ventures, especially as it falls outside the scope of the tech world and does not have the TAM&#x2F;SAM&#x2F;SOM projections that I&#x27;m sure VCs dream about.

It may even be a bit presumptuous to assume that it&#x27;s even possible for matter to ever detect the presence of anti-matter. Because, detecting the presence of anti-matter just constitutes looking at the radiation left behind by a &quot;collision&quot; with matter. That&#x27;s not observing anti-matter, it&#x27;s an after-the-fact conclusion, that there must had been anti-matter before the radiation in question appeared. As soon as matter <i>observes</i>&#x2F;<i>comes in contact with</i> anti-matter, it&#x27;s no longer matter. So matter, in and of itself, seemingly cannot observe anti-matter (because it&#x27;s transformed into something else at the moment it does).<p>Reading Wikipedia, it also appears that the matter&#x2F;anti-matter relationship is asymmetric:<p>Bondi pointed out that a negative mass will fall toward (and not away from) &quot;normal&quot; matter, since although the gravitational force is repulsive, the negative mass (according to Newton&#x27;s law, F=ma) responds by accelerating in the opposite of the direction of the force. Normal mass, on the other hand, will fall away from the negative matter. <i>He noted that two identical masses, one positive and one negative, placed near each other will therefore self-accelerate in the direction of the line between them, with the negative mass chasing after the positive mass.</i> Notice that because the negative mass acquires negative kinetic energy, the total energy of the accelerating masses remains at zero. Forward pointed out that the self-acceleration effect is due to the negative inertial mass, and could be seen induced without the gravitational forces between the particles. \n  --- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-gravity#General_relativity_research_in_the_1950s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-gravity#General_relativit...</a><p>Fascinating stuff!", "id": 12279279, "time": 1471041416, "type": "comment", "by": "runeks"}], "descendants": 11, "url": "http://www.nature.com/news/morphing-neutrinos-provide-clue-to-antimatter-mystery-1.20405", "title": "Morphing neutrinos provide clue to antimatter mystery", "by": "okket", "score": 24, "time": 1471014732, "type": "story", "id": 12276331}, {"kids": [{"kids": [{"parent": 12278146, "text": "Differential Privacy has its limits for small data sets.

It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug. The attraction of this way of writing is that it is easy. It is easier -- even quicker, once you have the habit -- to say <i>In my opinion it is not an unjustifiable assumption that</i> than to say <i>I think</i>. If you use ready-made phrases, you not only don&#x27;t have to hunt about for the words; you also don&#x27;t have to bother with the rhythms of your sentences since these phrases are generally so arranged as to be more or less euphonious. When you are composing in a hurry -- when you are dictating to a stenographer, for instance, or making a public speech -- it is natural to fall into a pretentious, Latinized style. Tags like <i>a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind</i> or <i>a conclusion to which all of us would readily assent</i> will save many a sentence from coming down with a bump.

They are, but they belong to the same category as \u201cliar\u201d and \u201cpervert\u201d and \u201cmadman.\u201d They are conversation-stoppers. When a court allows videotape from a hidden camera to be used in a trial, people shout \u201cBig Brother.\u201d When a politician refers to his proposal to permit logging on national land as \u201cenvironmentally friendly,\u201d he is charged with \u201cdoublethink.\u201d When a critic finds sexism in a poem, she is accused of being a member of the \u201cthought police.\u201d The terms can be used to discredit virtually any position, which is one of the reasons that Orwell became everyone&#x27;s favorite political thinker. People learned to make any deviation from their own platform seem the first step on the slippery slope to \u201c1984.\u201d<p>And:<p>&gt; Orwell wrote many strong essays, but \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d published in 1946, is not one of them. Half of the essay is an attack on bad prose. Orwell is against abstractions, mixed metaphors, Latinate roots, polysyllabic words, clich\u00e9s, and most of the other stylistic vices identified in Fowler&#x27;s \u201cModern English Usage\u201d (in its fourth printing in 1946). The other half is an attack on political dishonesty. Certain political terms, Orwell argues, are often used in a consciously dishonest way. ... Fowler would have found nothing to complain about, though, in the sentences Orwell objects to. They are as clear as can be. Somehow, Orwell has run together his distaste for flowery, stale prose with his distaste for fascism, Stalinism, and Roman Catholicism. He makes it seem that the problem with fascism (and the rest) is, at bottom, a problem of style. They&#x27;re bad, we are encouraged to feel, because their language is bad, because they&#x27;re ugly.<p>&gt; This is not an isolated instance of this way of thinking in Orwell. From his earliest work, he was obsessed with body odor ... Smell has no relation to virtue, however. Ugliness has no relation to insincerity or evil, and short words with Anglo-Saxon roots have no relation to truth or goodness. Political speech, like etiquette, has its codes and its euphemisms, and Orwell is right to insist that it is important to be able to decipher them. He says that if what he calls political speech\u2014by which he appears to mean political clich\u00e9s\u2014were translated into plain, everyday speech, confusion and insincerity would begin to evaporate. It is a worthy, if unrealistic, hope. But he does not stop there. All politics, he writes, \u201cis a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.\u201d And by the end of the essay he has damned the whole discourse: \u201cPolitical language\u2014and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists\u2014is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable.\u201d All political parties? Orwell had sniffed out a tendency.<p>It&#x27;s a great, thoughtful piece, I recommend reading the whole thing.<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2003&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;honest-decent-wrong\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2003&#x2F;01&#x2F;27&#x2F;honest-decent-w...</a>", "id": 12276113, "time": 1471013289, "type": "comment", "by": "lobster_johnson"}], "parent": 12271030, "text": "I detest this essay.

All the info and tickets are in the same place and I can follow certain events &#x2F; groups and get notifications when new concerts pop up. If the events I&#x27;m &quot;going&quot; to could automatically be added to my Showlist I&#x27;d be completely sold!<p>Also I&#x27;ve noticed that this is geared toward there being 1 artist&#x2F;band at each show. This might be different for different genres, but here in NL the Drum &amp; Bass scene has like 5-6 names playing at each event so it is a bit tedious to have to enter each one manually. Again I think Facebook event integration would be a great solution to this issue because the official events have all the information about the concert if you can manage to recognize the relevant information in each post.<p>I think Facebook probably has the most complete summary of events across all genres if you can find a way to parse out the non-concert related events. This is probably pretty hard to implement well, but might work out with a smart enough spider crawling Facebook.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;showlist.io&#x2F;@JeeCeeBees\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;showlist.io&#x2F;@JeeCeeBees</a> :)", "id": 12281109, "time": 1471088472, "type": "comment", "by": "jeeceebees"}, {"parent": 12281077, "text": "Thanks for understanding.<p>Choosing the artwork is a great idea, adding it to the list.

Flutter uses the Dart language, so there&#x27;s a Dart environment included in Fuchsia too [2].<p>For rendering, Fuchsia includes a project called Escher [3] which is described as a physically based renderer that supports soft shadows, light diffusion and other advanced effects. Looking at the source code, Escher is designed to use either OpenGL or Vulkan as the underlying graphics API. (There&#x27;s an iOS example project included in Escher&#x27;s source tree. Would be interesting to build that.)<p>It&#x27;s not immediately obvious why a lightweight operating system would need a renderer that can do realtime soft shadows and light effects...!

Shadows and subtle color reflections are a major part of that &quot;layered paper&quot; aesthetic.<p>So, the stack seems to be: Dart is the language for GUI apps, Flutter provides the widgets, and Escher renders the layers.<p>The underlying application framework is called Mojo [4]. It already offers bindings for Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust in addition to Dart, but maybe those languages are meant for services rather than GUI apps.

No meteors, no lighting strikes, and while thermal vents can produce some heat you aren&#x27;t going to be lighting fire, smelting metal, not to mention building LED&#x27;s under water.<p>4) Planetary resources and mineral composition slightly less important but also quite important for higher technological advancements fossil fuels in any forms are going to be pretty important as an energy source, it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;ll be able to jump from slavery to fusion without having some energy sources in the middle, you can somewhat compensate with biomass fuels but fossil fuels (doesn&#x27;t have to be oil) are pretty important.\nAs far as more advanced technologies than the availability of light metals such as aluminum and titanium might be somewhat important as well as &quot;rare earth&quot; elements which are used to make semiconductors.\nIf you somehow evolve on a planet that doesn&#x27;t have the required resources to build semiconductors (unlikely but somewhat possible) you are some what unlikely to go much beyond the mid industrial phase, given enough time you might be able to compensate and have some steampunk rocketry and tiny electromechanical computers but don&#x27;t discount how important solid state computers are for technological advancement.<p>5) Gravity there is an upper limit on the how strong the gravity can be for technological society to develop also with gravity going much beyond 1.5-2 earth&#x27;s technological advancement becomes less likely both because the implication it would have the physiology of the species that develop under such conditions and because it makes projectiles, flight, and rocketry less likely or even impossible which sets a higher limit on how much a society can advance or at least at what rate.<p>And there are many other factors that have certain limitations or highly favorable states that need to be met for technological advancement. If we take what we know about evolution, especially converging evolution, what we know is required to build or achieve certain technological advancement and what conditions are required for those things to be likely to occur you get a situation where while life can take any shape form or size it&#x27;s considerably likely that if one day a spaceship lands and a few E.T. are going to come out of it they would be considerably more similar to us than to a cockroach, snake, turtle, crab or any other shape or form you can imagine life can create, at least externally.", "id": 12282155, "time": 1471108033, "type": "comment", "by": "dogma1138"}], "parent": 12280629, "text": "Why must they be similar to us?<p>For instance, I completely accept that a sightless entity, as we have sight, could develop a technological culture.", "id": 12280659, "time": 1471074027, "type": "comment", "by": "germinalphrase"}], "parent": 12280432, "text": "Again you are extrapolating the wrong things.<p>Can&#x27;t have incremental development underwater.<p>Magnesium torches have thier own oxidizer.<p>Find a way to refine magnesium underwater.<p>I can imagine a lot of things but it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s possible.<p>Technological life forms are going to be pretty similar to us.\nSight, fine motor skills and various other aspects are going to be pretty close.", "id": 12280629, "time": 1471073263, "type": "comment", "by": "dogma1138"}], "parent": 12280058, "text": "You can have fire underwater, take for example Magnesium torches.

Nothing. Keep your code private. If you&#x27;d like to stop maintaining code but want to make sure it sticks around, the DOE has a software library, the ESTSC, in Oak Ridge (a division of OSTI). It may also be the case that the entity running the lab wants to claim ownership.<p>2. Open Source. Due diligence is needed to ensure funding agencies and MOUs are respected. Copyright is typically assigned to the contractor running the lab in question (i.e. for Berkeley lab, -&gt; Copyright goes to UC, SLAC -&gt; Stanford, etc...). Major international collaborations can be a bit tricky because foreign countries have their own rules. I think more work needs to be emphasized on this front going forwards.<p>The DOE also wants to track the popularity of Open Source software, namely downloads. GitHub has met their requirements for reporting.<p>The DOE discourages use of the GPL and similar licenses. The reason, as I understand it, is due to the fact that the Government (i.e. Defense) must be able to use and modify software (and give to contractors, etc...) without falling under any additional burden. I believe the BSD license is preferred most widely across the labs.<p>In some cases, people at labs do release software under GPL. If they didn&#x27;t get special permission, they are likely violating their lab&#x27;s contract with the DOE.<p>3. Commercialize. This is really hard. You have to first perform market research, establish the market, spin off, deal with SBIRs, etc... This is a high barrier.<p>I&#x27;ve been personally working on streamlining the process for (2) with legal for my lab, so that anybody can open source their software very easily, hopefully by just filling out a web page. I&#x27;m hoping the recent white house directives help eliminate some of the bureaucracy involved in the process. I&#x27;ve also been trying to reduce fragmentation across the lab. The lab has never offered an official SCM platform, and grad students&#x2F;postdocs are notoriously bad at keeping important source code in their personal GitHub and then leaving after some time.<p>It should be noted that almost all national lab facilities are effectively ran under contract, so nearly all national lab employees are not actually federal employees. So we do have a slightly different set of rules.<p>Finally, there is already a decent presence on github and bitbucket of labs, in case you are interested:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LLNL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LLNL</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org&#x2F;berkeleylab&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org&#x2F;berkeleylab&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slaclab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slaclab</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NERSC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NERSC</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sandialabs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sandialabs</a><p>It should be noted this is an extremely, extremely small slice of the software that drives experiments, projects, and research in the lab.
